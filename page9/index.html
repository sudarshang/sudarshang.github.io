    <p>Love is an ugly terrible business
practised by fools
it will trample your heart
and leave you bleeding on the floor
and what does it really get u in the end
nothing but a few incredible memories
that you can never shake.</p>

<dl><dt><span class="term">statically typed language</span></dt><dd>A language in which types are fixed at compile time.

<p>I like these clear and concise definitions. Hope it reduces the confusion between dynamic typing and strong typing</p>

    <p>I remember reading ths book, a couple of years ago. Among all the books I have read this one had the most profound impact on my life. My own personel search for meaning continues. Here are two of my favorite Victor Frankl quotes :-</p>

<blockquote>"Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is <em>he</em> who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by <em>answering for</em> his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible."</blockquote>


<blockquote>We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: <em>the last of the human freedoms -- to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.</em></blockquote>

    <p>By blogging intentions not withstanding here is one more zero value entry.</p>

<p>I love these <a href="http://www.lokparitran.org/">guys</a>. I envy their courage and self confidence. At the same time I know they do not have a snow balls chance in hell. If only they had a nice PayPal donation box. I would have donated a few dollars and my conscience would be at ease.
Many times I feel my nearly 28 years on this earth have just been a waste. I was once talking with a friend from Nepal who works in the human rights organization there. I was surprised that this young lady who is 5 years younger than me is playing a much more socially relevant role than I can even imagine. During my conversations ( gmail chats ) with her I could not but help feeling ashamed of the fact that I have still not impacted any one's life positively.</p>

    <blockquote>"Besides a mathematical inclination, an exceptionally good mastery of one's native tongue is the most vital asset of a competent programmer."</blockquote>

<p>Almost every competent programmer I know writes extremely well. I wish I could write as well as them. ( Maybe then I could also count myself among them ). Every programmer who is good thinks of the programs that he writes as a way of communicating his thoughts. Now I guess people who are good at communicating their thoughts in one medium are also good at doing the same in another. Well one of the reasons I started this blog was to teach myself how to write clearly and concisely. I do not think I have done a good job of this so far. Also most of my posts are just irrelevant rants. I have not really thought about what value I should be providing those who actually might read them. Most of these posts zero value.</p>

<p>If this blog is to serve it's purpose I must find a topic that I can write about regularly. I have a friend <a href="http://cpptruths.blogspot.com/">C++ Truths</a> who does a pretty good job about writing about a subject near to his heart. One of my problems is that there are too many subjects near to my heart that I want to blog about. Maybe I should have two blogs a professional blog where I try to write something that is technical and interesting and a personal blog which will be password protected and available only for friends and family.</p>

    <p>That's what they call American's of Asian origins. Just like ABCD is supposed to stand for American Born Confused Desi. Banana stands for our Asian bethren who were raised in this land of milk and honey.</p>

<p>Now why BANANA? Is this a smart acronym? No it is even more racist than you would think. BANANA yellow on the outside white on the inside.</p>
