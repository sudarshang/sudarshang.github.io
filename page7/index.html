    <p>I just got my hands on the office 2007 beta. This is a test post with the new word blog features. Sadly they get the post timestamp wrong. So this means I have to go back and edit the timestamp. However this at least lets me type in Word and benefit from the Word spell check.</p>

    <p>I have given up my cell phone for the next month. Instead I am using skype ( with a 12 dollar skypein subscription ) and unlimited free calling in USA. It basically means that I am available only when I am in front of a machine. We will see how this goes.</p>

    <p>C# allows us to use keywords as variable names as long as they are prefixed with the @ symbol. So @if, @while, @do is all valid C#.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Everyday when I drive back from work (the drive just 10 minutes) I listen to the [Cool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bKisYRBDZg)" and say man i really wish she was still my friend after playing football with my heart.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have often heard that guys do not really care about relationships. I find most of my friends heart broken and dejected for years after being while jilted while the other person has moved on and often got married. This goes back to the conversation I once had with Alex. He was insistent that whatever relationship one gets into it should not be the be all and end all of life. It is important to have a happy and fulfilling life for oneself independent of anyone or anything else. How to get to the happy and fulfilling life is an independent problem whose solution I still seek.</p>

        Mixed Doubles

    <time datetime="2006-05-29T17:39:23-05:00" class="post-date">29 May 2006</time>

    <p>I have been in the USA for nearly 3 years now without a trip back home to India. For a long time nearly a year (before I came to the Bay Area) I had zero contact with any things Indian. Did not eat Indian food or watch Hindi movies nor listened to Hindi music. Here I am back with my friends from High School days and I get nearly all the Indian culture I can handle. Most of the time i wonder if India really changed so much in the 3 years that I was not there. A friend talks about a no strings affair he had when he was in India for an internhsip, other friends tell me about their Indian girl friends sleeping around. And then finally I watched this movie "Mixed Doubles". I have not seen a bolder Indian movie.</p>

<p>The movie starts with a marketing executive Sunil loosing his libido and unable to satify his wife Malti (Konkona Sen Sharma ). He meets his US based friend who looks 10 years younger and attributes it to his swinging life style. Now that is the biggestÂ  piece of b. s. I have heard. I beleive I am fitter at 28 than I was at 24 when I left India. But that is because of the gym workouts and regular exercise as well as the high protein diet. I didn't do no swinging. Any ways Sunil decides to adopt the swinger life style and finally finds a couple ready to wife swap.</p>

<p>The movie is beautifully made. There is nothing out of the world about this movie. From the cars they drive to the clothes the wear Sunil and Malti come across as the usual upwardly mobile yuppie family. Maybe that is the reason I found this movie so shocking. It is like the traditional orthodox India that I left behind no longer exists. In some weird ways I am truly uprooted. I am neither an American in the sense that I have not really adapted to the life here. At the same time the India I left behind ( in 2000 actually as I was mostly out of India after that) no longer exists. I need to find a wayout of this conundrum.</p>

    <p>I had borrowed this movie from the Las Cruces city library, but the DVD I borrowed turned out to be kaput and I could only watch it half way. Tonite I finished watching it. As movies go this was one of the very best that I have ever seen. It has a beautiful story, brilliant screenplay and amazing direction.</p>

<p>This movie takes place in Germany after the reunification. It's a period of considerable social unrest. The film's plot is concerned with a single mother, Christiane Kerner (Katrin Sass) whose physician husband suddenly defected to the West years before. As the wife of a defector, Christiane initially faced a great deal of suspicion from the authorities. In the ensuing years, she raised her two children, Alex (Daniel Bruhl) and Ariane, alone, and she's carved out a life for herself with the hand she's been dealt. Christiane is a tireless idealist who now receives recognition from the authorities for her contributions to the Communist party and to the state. One night, Alex is arrested during a demonstration, and Christiane collapses and falls into a coma at the shock.</p>

<p>In the 8 months Christiane spends in a coma, East Germany undergoes permanent, irrevocable changes. People who'd built their whole lives around a political ideal lived to see it crashing down (literally) with the destruction of the Berlin Wall. East Germans rapidly embrace the changes--everything from clothing, diet, and furniture. Everyday life changes with phenomenal speed, and this all takes place while Christiane slumbers on.</p>

<p>Then one day, Christiane wakes up. And this presents Alex with a dilemma. He believes that his mother would suffer a relapse if she discovers the truth about the destruction of East Germany. Christiane's friends, family and neighbours conspire to create the illusion that nothing has changed. Alex is aided and abetted in the deception by Denis, a would-be filmmaker. Denis and Alex's efforts are hilarious, but there's a serious side to all of this. The film includes footage of the wall collapsing, and the film really does a remarkable and amazing job showing how life rapidly changed for East Germans who were desperate to absorb Western culture. There are some scenes that are unforgettable. But apart from this, the film also is a moving story of the devotion between Alex and his mother.</p>

<p>I enjoyed this movie in various ways. I took in a few years of German when I was in high school. It was great to hear long forgotten words and phrases again. Some of the scenes in this movie are memorable. The shot of a helicopter carrying a statue of Lenin over the streets of East Berlin is unforgettable. It shows how a family is affected by a political upheaval and then makes no comments about politics itself. I concentrates on the characters and show how the change. I have often beleived that the greatest action is the what happens inside the heart and the mind. And it takes a really great movie to potray this action. Good Bye Lenin does exactly that.</p>

    <p>Well the concatenation works only with string literals. For example this fails to compile</p>

<p>char <em>s1 = "Hello ";
char </em>s2 = "World\n";</p>

<p>printf(s1 s2);
I am guessing that the concatenation happens either in the lexical analysis phase or during the parsing and not in the semantic analysis phase as <a href="http://www.sudarshan.org/blog/wp-admin/www.samat.org">Samat</a> thinks.</p>
