<p>Almost every competent programmer I know writes extremely well. I wish I could write as well as them. ( Maybe then I could also count myself among them ). Every programmer who is good thinks of the programs that he writes as a way of communicating his thoughts. Now I guess people who are good at communicating their thoughts in one medium are also good at doing the same in another. Well one of the reasons I started this blog was to teach myself how to write clearly and concisely. I do not think I have done a good job of this so far. Also most of my posts are just irrelevant rants. I have not really thought about what value I should be providing those who actually might read them. Most of these posts zero value.</p>

<p>If this blog is to serve it's purpose I must find a topic that I can write about regularly. I have a friend <a href="http://cpptruths.blogspot.com/">C++ Truths</a> who does a pretty good job about writing about a subject near to his heart. One of my problems is that there are too many subjects near to my heart that I want to blog about. Maybe I should have two blogs a professional blog where I try to write something that is technical and interesting and a personal blog which will be password protected and available only for friends and family.</p>
