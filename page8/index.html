printf(msg);

<p>int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
{
printf(“Hello “
“World\n”);
myfunc(“Hello “

<p>return 0;

Well I did not know this but C concatenates adjacent string literals. The above example actually does print “Hello World” twice.</p>

Well as a movie Sarkar is not in the same league as Godfather. I like movies that are realistic. So if a movie forces me to suspend disbelief then the price of admission was a waste. Sarkar is not able to match the realism of Godfather. Also the soundtrack for Sarkar is atrocious. There is this one chat of “ Govinda,  Govinda …. “ all through the god damn movie.  I guess I can just excuse Sarkar as the best that bollywood can come up with. The two Bachans are no match for Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. The other problem is can a story really be transplanted from one culture into another. In Godfather the Don might be reasonable but he is no less evil. In Sarkar the Don is almost a saint we do not see any of his nefarious activities. All in all I could have done just as well skipping this movie.</h2>

    <p>I rarely listen to music. I mean i never go out of my way to listen to music. Most of the time I use music ( western classical Mozart et al) to drown the background noise in my cube. As some people know i do not listen to music I watch music videos ( if you know what I mean ). However when it comes to popular music there is one artist I admire and she is Shakira.  I still remember the first time I saw her “Whenever Where ever” video. <a href="http://l1w0lf.blogspot.com/">Anshuman</a> and I used to work as contractors at Confluence Networks ( a company that no longer exists ). We were late to go to work when the video came up on the tele. Both of us just sat our asses down and decided to watch the video before making a move. There is another of her videos that nearly as good “La Tortura”.</p>

    <p>People who know me from my NMSU days might remember the huge stack of library books stashed away in my office. I am a big book/ book borrowing addict. I guess most of my discretionary income is spent on books and library late fees. Some pray for world peace all I want is an end to late fees.
The high point of my life in Pune used to be trips to BCL. The only expense I used to have has been the late fees. My fascination for libraries started even before my parents developed <a href="http://www.slimpp.com/">library software</a>. My high school, Loyola, has fabulous sport facilities: - large playgrounds, beautiful swimming pool and a rolling hill to go along with it. However as a kid I was not interested in any of them. I spent all my time at the library. I read every magazine the library subscribed. I guess I had read nearly every book that was accessible for students in the high school. So when I had to (my low scores in SSC exams ensured this ) to go back to Loyola for junior college I got the opportunity to read all the books marked of for junior college students.</p>

<p>My summer holidays would start with me getting some money from my parents to join the local library. These libraries would have a policy such as only one book issued out per day. This would lead me to read a book a day. The usual schedule:- get up, wait for the library to open, read the book rinse repeat.</p>

<p>Sometimes due to work pressure or exams I would go for nearly a week or two without reading a book. During such periods I end up dreaming that I am reading something. I find that a prolonged abstinence from book consumption not only destroys my sleep but also my creativity. The only cure is to go grab a book and read it from start to finish.</p>

    <p>The fuzzball table at work serves as a release for a whole bunch of us. I had never played this game before I started my current gig. These days I think I am doing pretty well with at fuzzball. However whenever someone scores an own goal at fuzzball I am reminded of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9s_Escobar">this.</a></p>

<p>For a long time I was confusing the football player Escobar with the drug dealer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_Escobar">Escobar</a> . The way my mind works and using it along with Google to retrieve almost lost memories has always left me awestruck.</p>
