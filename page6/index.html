<p>This a great talk by Kent Beck on "ease at work", a talk about attitudes that programmers should adopt while at work.Do listen to this  if you write code for a living.</p>

<p>Highlights</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ease means that one is in a state of comfort "it is ok for me to be here doing what I am doing".</li>
    <li>Difference between Yosemite and Great America ( a recreational park in the Bay Area). You can have a good time at Great America but the next day your still the same person while going to Yosemite can change you.</li>
</ul>


<p>It has been a day since I have listened to this talk and I am still trying to adopt these attitudes.</p>

    <p>I came upon this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_Hierarchy_Process"> Analytic Hierarchy Process</a> (AHP) mentioned in this paper. Now how can I use this in real life? The problem I see is that it is not that easy to assign weights to various attributes. Then again most of the time I make most decisions entirely randomly so a framework might at least give the whole thing an illusion of a process.</p>

    <time datetime="2006-07-02T14:08:13-05:00" class="post-date">02 Jul 2006</time>

    <p>I just came across this definition</p>

<blockquote>Geeks, Nerds, and Dorks: A geek has a very focused knowledge of a subject (that guy that memorized the language of myst), a nerd is a master at many subjects (that girl you go to when you need homework help), and a dork is just plain socially inept (Napoleon Dynamite).</blockquote>


<p>Now I guess "dork" is what describes me most aptly and Napoleon Dynamite is a movie I really identify with. I remember watching that movie with a couple of friends in Las Cruces. Now both of them (a guy and a girl) were among the "in" crowd all their lives. Both of them could barely sit throught Napoloen Dynamite. Maybe they found the movie extremely slow or maybe they too saw  some relections of themselves in the movie and did not like what the mirror showed them.</p>

<p><img width="300" src="http://www.sudarshan.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/alex.jpg" />
Alex Dubman is my boss at Asempra. He is the other member of the feared and dreaded EXRS team. EXRS is the project that two of us have been working at for the past 6 months. Along with being a great manager Alex is a great all around guy. He is the kind of guy you want on your side and guarding your back. Alex has also been my workout partner for the past 6 months. He excels at this role of a drill sergent and keeps pushing all who workout with him to go beyond the point of failure</p>

        Shallow Hal starring "Tony Robbins"

    <p><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0256380/">Shallow Hal</a> is one of my favorite movies. I have been called shallow and superficial to my face but that is a story for another day. Well so there is the Guru that Shallow Hal meets in the movie who transforms and lets him see the inner beauty. The part of the Guru was played by Tony Robbins who is a great motivational speaker in real life. I watched his <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=tony_robbins">visual</a> </a>from the TED conference and I guess the next time he shows up in the Bay Area I am going to go listen to him. These days I am readingÂ  motivational books. When I think I am filled with negative emotions  I try to  control them and think more positively. Among these books "The Power of Now" has had the most beneficial impact.</p>

        What motivates Entrepreneurs

    <time datetime="2006-06-17T23:45:00-05:00" class="post-date">17 Jun 2006</time>

    <p>From <a href="http://munjal.typepad.com/recognizing_deven/2006/06/episode_5_april.html">Recognizing Deven</a></p>

<blockquote>Entrepreneurs are an odd bunch.  As an entrepreneur you create a vision of what can be and then work really hard to make that happen.  It is your imprint on the world. It is your legacy.  Maybe 2000 years ago if you wanted to leave a mark you would be Julius Cesear or Genghis Khan.  Today you start a technology or Internet company.  I believe almost all entrepreneurs seek immortality through their products.  This is one of the reasons we all seek to build products that are used by and benefit the lives of as many people as possible.  We want to do good, but we also want to be remembered.  Some admit this and some don't, but it is true.  The greatest crusades in the world are always for the intangible.    There is no other explanation for why founder's of companies work so hard and sacrifice so much.  Money can only account for so much of this.   You have to believe that you are on this planet to somehow change it.</blockquote>


<p>This just about sums up why I want to be an entrepreneur</p>
