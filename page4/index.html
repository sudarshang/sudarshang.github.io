    <p>I am reading a fascinating book, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bug-Ellen-Ullman/dp/1400032350">The Bug</a>" by Jesse Ullman, these days. It contains a description of programming with which I completely agree</p>

<blockquote>Programming starts out like it’s going to be architecture – all black lines on white paper, theoretical and abstract and spatial and up-in-the-head. Then, right around the time you have to get something <em>fucking </em>working, it has this nasty tendency to turn into <em>plumbing</em>.</blockquote>


<blockquote>…</blockquote>


<blockquote>It’s more like you’re hired as a plumber to work in an old house full of ancient, leaky pipes laid out by some long-gone plumbers who were even weirder than you are. Most of the time you spend scratching your head and thinking: Why the <em>fuck </em>did they do <em>that</em>?</blockquote>

    <p>I have been intending to write this post for a while. Kept putting it of as it might seem to corny but ...</p>

<p>A few months ago I read this <a href="http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/2006/08/25/dont-marry-a-smart-woman/">blog post</a> by Joshua Allen. I have seen many unhappy relationship and  could not but think that it boiled down to low self esteem among the people involved. Since some of you might be too lazy to read the comments on that post here is what Allen thinks as high self esteem</p>

<blockquote>Let’s roughly define “high self-esteem” as, someone who is optimistic and positive about his/her own ability to have a positive influence on the world; who has internal locus of control versus external (that is, doesn’t blame others or ‘luck” for failure, and doesn’t take failure personally but sees it as learning). And finally, someone who sees that this attitude reflects the intrinsic worth of all people.</blockquote>


<p>Among all the couples that I have seen only Tieming and Bo Ding seem to have a great relationship and I guess it is because of how good they feel about themselves and how they make others around them also feel good.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245712/">"Love is a Bitch"</a> is a great movie by Alejandro González Iñárritu. I have seen his 21 grams and I am looking forward to Babel. I really like the way he makes his movies. I guess he is one of the few people more cynical than I am and his potrayl of human nature closely matches my beleifs about it. Technically the movie is just brilliant, the cinematography and the soundtrack are about as good as it gets. I really liked "La visa es un carnaval" and the beats were really apt for the scenes they were used in. The movie talks about the struggles we endure in our quest for love. It links up three different stories showing this struggle in its different phases and somehow manages to have a coherent structure. The story of Octavio deals with his love for his brother Romario's wife. Daniel's story deals with his love for a top model who will soon be tragically disfigured in an accident. The story of EL Chivo, a vagrant hitman, talks about his love for his daughter whom he left when she was 2 years old to become a guerilla. In all the cases the quest for love is futile and tragic.</p>

<p>I like movies like Amoresperros that cross the borders of language and culture and make such bold statements about universal themes such as love.</p>

    <p>Well this thumb rule obviously does not apply to people admited to the top programs. But if you are scrapping the bottom of the barrel with your choices here is what you can do -</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to the library catalog of the Universities that have admitted you.</li>
    <li>Search for books by Knuth.</li>
    <li>Select the University that has the largest number of different titles by Knuth.</li>
    <li>Break ties in favor of the University which has the larger number of such books checked out</li>
</ol>


<p>Regardless of where you go your time will be extremely well spent reading Knuth. If more of your peers are doing the same you will also  have some interesting conversations</p>

    <p>Today I was reading Richard Dawkin's book <a href="http://www.lyrics007.com/John%20Lennon%20Lyrics/Imagine%20Lyrics.html">lyrics </a>as soon as I found the mention of this song.</p>

<p>Now imagine a world without the current restrictive copyright regimes. People could build much richer experiences by connecting books, movies and music together. Imagine every book with an online version which not only contains the contents of the book but links it to news articles, music and movies. An online version which is live and vibrant, a wiki tended to by the many readers of the  book.</p>

<p>By the way the book refers to the song for the verse</p>

<blockquote>Imagine there's no countries</blockquote>


<blockquote>It isn't hard to do</blockquote>


<blockquote>Nothing to kill or die for</blockquote>


<blockquote>And no religion too</blockquote>


<blockquote>Imagine all the people</blockquote>


<blockquote>Living life in peace</blockquote>

<p>So for what it is worth I can still call myself a Hindu and an atheist. Hnduism really fascinates me from the philosophy of the Gita, to it's willingness to embrace multiple opposing thought streams. Check out the quote from Amartya Sen at the bottom of the page</p>

<p>I just came back from a trip to India after 3.5 years. The media keeps talking about "New India", home to expressways and malls, where the select few can enjoy everything available in the West as well as luxuries of the East such as house hold help. Now the really sad and disheartening part is that on a website frequented by these "select tech sayv few" you still see them organising themselves along caste lines. For me India has really not changed at all. All the things I dislike about it are still just as strong. The only difference is that now just like in the US where I am the only guy wearing slippers in a mall, I stand out like a sore thumb in an Indian mall too ;-).</p>
