    <p>A couple of weeks ago I went with Alex to a gun range in Santa Clara. Alex (my boss) is a huge gun fan and a hardcore libertarian. He has a nice collection of revolvers ( a nice Ruger for beginners, a Smith and Wesson, and a Colt when u really want to get serious). We went to the alley got our targets and started shooting at them. I think I am pretty accurate from about 20 yards. This is one of the cool things about being in the US. I do not think I would have had an oppurtunity to shoot pistols back home in India</p>

    <p>This is a great Channel 4 documentary presented by Richard Dawkins. He looks at religion (although he concentrates only on monotheistic religions such as Judaism, Christainity and Islam) and points out the great harm such delusional beleifs cause mankind. Some are often surprised by the confrontational tone he takes and the anger he displays at the ridiculous statements made by different religious leaders. But I think Dawkins is right. For too long has the moderation in religion been tolerated. Today when we see acts such as 9/11 and the picketing of Planned Parenthood offices a more stringent anti religion actions need to be taken. From a classification point of view all religious books should be moved into the fiction sections of book stores and libraries. If religious leaders demand that evolution be taught as just a theory (one of the many viewpoints about how human beings came about) then all religious education should also be pointed out as just delusional beleifs. Children should be taught that all concepts such as heaven, hell and after life are fragments of imagination without any basis in reality. Infact just as children are not allowed to learn certain things till they reach a mature age they should be sheilded from religion till they are capable of self determination.</p>

This is the one I liked the most
Good people will do good things, and bad people will do bad things. But for good people to do bad things -- that takes religion.

    <p>The problem with religion is that people are brought up right from childhood to think that there is something good about beleiving because you have been told to beleive rather than beleiving because you have looked at the evidence</p>

    <p>Great movie. Writing anything more about this movie is simply superflous. The movie grips you from the first minute and is extremely realisitic. At no point do you need to suspend disbeleif. The lead character <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1503432/">Catalina Sandino Moreno</a> is without doubt one of the best actresses to light up the screen ever. (Ofcourse I do not know if she was briliantly cast as Maria, to find out if she is really good I guess I will have to watch more movies starring her). Maria is just about the most graceful 17  year old potrayed in movie. From her confrontation with her boyfriend who fathers her child but does not love her to demanding her wages from drug dealers in New York she never seems to lose it. The way her character is built up all that she does seems extremely natural. I really liked the end of the movie where she decides to stay in the US and raise her child my herself instead of running home to be surrounded by loving family members.
All in all a brilliantly scripted, well directed excellent movie.</p>

    <p>Like all software development companies my workplace out sources some part of the development. The grapevine says you cannot get funded today unless you show how you are cutting costs using outsourcing.</p>

<p>My component interacts with a component that was out sourced. Today was spent banging my head against the following error thrown by the out sourced component</p>

<blockquote>
"External Error"

The operation was successful
</blockquote>


<p>I wanted to write the developer of the component an email and ask him if he found successful operations so rare that he flagged them as errors</p>

    <p>In my usuall ramblings across the internet I sometimes come on gems such as this <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20030122042757/http://www.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/The_Pursuit_of_Emptyness.html">one</a>
Here is my favorite part of the essay</p>

<blockquote>
Finally, and always, there is love. By this, I don't mean that economic bargain that often passes for love these days. I don't mean that I will love you if you get good grades, or that I will love you if you'll sleep with me, or that I will love you if anything. I mean what I mean when I say, "I love you." Period. Without expectation, condition, term limit, codicil, or obligation. To say that - and to mean it in that way - makes me happy.

What makes me happiest of all is when someone says "I love you" to me - meaning it as unconditionally as I intend to mean it - and I simply accept it. Learning to accept unconditional love has been the most demanding part of my education. It requires me to love myself as much as I am loved, which is not easy, since I like to pretend that my loathsome short-comings are invisible to all but me.

    <p>After a hiatus of nearly two and a half years I watched a Hindi movie. I made a feeble attempt at watching Dus but was unable to endure it for more than an hour. Mani Ratnam is one of those rare Indian directors who treats movies as an art form not just eye candy. As a youth Roja and Bombay were my favorite movies. Yuva is supposed to be his look at the today’s Indian youth. It also serves up dollops of patriotism and idealism which are purely fictional. Although the story is inspirational I felt that Mani Ratnam seems to have lost his touch. Or maybe I am incapable of sitting thru long three hours movies anymore.
The other person who seems to have lost his touch is A. R. Rehman. None of the songs is memorable. I tried listening to the songs again hoping they might grow on me but no such luck. They are just unhummable. More than half the movie is flash backs trying to build the three main characters Ajay Devgan’s Michael Mukherjee the idealistic student leader who wants to reform Indian politics, Vivek Oberoi’s Arjun a college kid who chases women and wants to pursue a MBA at Cornell, and Abhishek Bachan’s Lallan, the muscle of the local politician.
While Ajay Devgan’s  Michael Mukherjee was entirely fictional I could easily identify with Vivek Oberoi’s Arjun. Most of my friends have been through this phase. The lure of the west is still irresistible in spite of the much higher standard of living now afforded to certain professionals in India. However the character that left the largest impression was Lallan. The absolute lack of morals and the will to power was almost Nietzschean. I have always believed that as an actor Abhishek Bachan was a better actor than his father. And in this movie he demonstrates it.</p>
