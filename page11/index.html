    <p>These days I am working on a project where I am maitaining a body of code that was developd in C#. For some reason that I have not been able to fathom the previous developer used the following paradigm.
<em>
Certain classes are pure data. They do not have any code other than getter and setter functions. Then there are other managerial classes that actually maipulate these classes. The organization is usually a class named XXX_Data and another named XXX_DataManager.</em></p>

<p>This I beleive violates the fundamental principles of Object Oriented Programming.
I wish these <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articleIndex">articles </a> are required reading for any developer before he starts belting out code</p>

    <p>Hmm looks like I have an opinion on just about everything under the sun but here goes .....</p>

<p>According to me the most important human value is freedom. The question is what exactly are the limits to be imposed by society on freedom. A simple rule that I hope will be used is that you are free to do what you want as long as you do not force any one else to do something that they are unwilling to do. So I am free to kill you if you are not unwilling to die. There I go supporting euthanasia.
I am free to draw (if I had the ability or the time) caricatures of whoever I want from (Christ to Krishna to the Prophet) you are free to not look at my caricatures. The problem with most fanatics and I include any one who engages in the irrationality of religion as a fanatic is that in some ways the believe that religious beliefs are in someway sacrosanct and free from criticism. If a single person believed that muttering Latin over glass of wine made it the blood of Christ he would be committed to the insane asylum but if a billion people believe then it is a world religion.Also most religious people do not realise that most of their beliefs are inherited. If they were born in a different religion or culture they would have adopted those beliefs. I have seen arguements such how the namaaz is the greatest excercise for your back and how vegeteraniasm is the best diet for human beings.  And for some reason all religious beliefs are of limits to the righteous ridicule that they deserve. Coming back to the free speech argument I can say whatever I want about any religion. You are under no obligation to listen to my rants.</p>

    <p>One of my all time favorite movies is <a href="http://www.heromovie.org/">Hero</a> directed by Zhang Yimou. The cinematography is breathtaking and it has all the action that would appeal to lovers of martial arts. However I like this movie for its political message and what it really means to be a hero. The Hero does not achieve his immediate aim of assassination as he believes that the Emperor would lead China and the Chinese people to a much better future. Now China is a large country with a population larger than India's. It benefits greatly from the one language and one culture that unifies Chinese people all over the world. I have some close Chinese friends at school and find that the Chinese expat community in most places is more cohesive than the Indian community. When I look back at my NMSU days and remember the cliques that were formed along regional lines I realise how much India has lost by not having one language and one culture. India had an opportunity after independence to rectify this. If only we had adopted Maulana Azad's proposal of replacing the urdu and devnagiri scripts with the roman script a national language would have had a better chance of adoption in South India. But our opportunistic politicians decided to divide up India into states based on language and today we are a potpourri of different people without any common identity.</p>

    <p>This blog started of during my job hunting phase. The early posts are lopsided and so meagre as I did not want to cause undue distress to possible future employers. Now that I am employed I plan to write just about what (whatever the f***) I want.
Posting will be more regular.</p>
